# face-detection-blurring-
This project uses Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to perform real-time face detection and blurring on a live webcam feed. The primary purpose is to automatically anonymize faces for privacy. The script detects all faces in the frame, applies a strong blur effect to them, and draws a green bounding box around each one for clear visualization.
